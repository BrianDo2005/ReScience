## The ReScience journal

Re**Science** is a journal that target computational research and encourage the
explicit reproduction of already published research using a new and open-source
implementation in order to ensure the original research is actually
reproducible.To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically
different from any other traditional scientific journal and Re**Science** lives
mainly on [github](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/wiki) where each
implementation is made available together with the comments, explanations,
tests and documentation. Each submission takes the form of a pull request that
is publicly reviewed and tested in order to guarantee actual reproducibility.
